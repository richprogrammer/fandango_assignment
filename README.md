Data Manipulation

Assignment: Fandango Movie Ratings

Name:  Richard Lee

Data

Our data set comes from the data journalism site, [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), and was used for a 2015 article titled 
'[Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/)'.  
The first step of this project is to read this article as it sets up the rest of this assignment and so that you will understand the data.

Assignment

In this assignment, we will use Pandas to explore the data set from the article and to practice some basics including merging files.  Our 
data will be slightly different than the article as it appears they were working with a larger set of data.
